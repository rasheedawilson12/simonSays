A retro flex-box game based on the electronic game. Coded using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morriso in the 1970s. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
